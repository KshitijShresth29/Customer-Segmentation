# Customer_Segmentation
This project is performing customer segmentation to classify customers into different groups based on their purchase behavior (Monetary, Frequency, and Recency). The K-Means algorithm is used to cluster customers into three groups, and the 3D scatter plot is a visualization of these clusters in a three-dimensional space. This type of analysis can be useful for businesses to understand and target different customer segments more effectively.
It visualizes the clustered data in a 3D scatter plot. The x-axis represents 'frequency,' the y-axis represents 'recency,' and the z-axis represents 'Monetary.' The points are color-coded based on their cluster IDs.
